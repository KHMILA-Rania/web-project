        <h3>Loving Your Neighborhood</h3>

        I love coffee! In fact, I might even be a coffee snob. I won’t drink out of Styrofoam, I won’t drink Folgers or instant coffee, and I take pour-over equipment on camping trips to ensure I have my gourmet cup around the campfire.
        <br>
        Sadly, for years I could not say that I loved my local community as much as I loved my boujee coffee. Larry (my husband) and I started pastoring a small church in North Long Beach, California that existed in an extremely diverse and increasingly violent neighborhood. Andy Street, the most notorious street in Long Beach due to the number of gang related murders, is a few hundred feet from our church doorstep. I did not love Andy Street. Ramona Park, a dangerous park in Long Beach due to the ongoing gang warfare and drug dealing, was a half mile away. I did not love Ramona Park.
        <br>
        Our local community was desperate for hope, for healing, and for love - exactly our calling as Christ followers since Jesus came to break the chains of bondage, bring recovery of sight to the blind, set the oppressed free, and proclaim good news to the poor (Luke 4:18-19). But I was missing his mission. Instead, I was primarily interested in growing the attendance of our local church, Light & Life. My definition of church success didn’t have much room for living out Christ’s mission in our troubled neighborhood.
        <br>
        I am embarrassed to admit it took fifteen years for my heart to truly start to love my community. Prior to that, my efforts to serve were half-hearted expressions of doing my Christian duty and, honestly, there was an underlying motive of “I hope they come to my church, so we grow bigger.” Self-interest tainted my discipleship.
        <br>
        So, when did my heart change? What did I stop and start doing that helped me fall in love with those who lived within our one-mile radius?
        <br>
        Part of my transformation began when God brought Calvin and Sarah Tatupu to Light & Life. This beautiful Samoan couple lived in our local neighborhood. They lived among our non-white neighbors who were hurting, who were impacted by gang violence, addictions, and food insecurity. One night, bullets from a drive-by shooting hit their bed’s headboard, nearly killing them. They fully understood AND deeply loved our neighborhood. Jesus spoke to me and said, “I have sent Calvin and Sarah as your teachers, if you are willing.” I was convicted and embraced my new mentors.

        <h3>Discerning the Needs of Your Community</h3>

            If you want to make an impact in your community, you need to first see and understand its needs. Asking local leaders questions about their work and the community's needs is a great starting point. At Newbreed, we want to help you take those steps towards loving your neighborhood, so we've created a five-part course: Missional Engagement: Taking Steps to Build Gospel Relationships.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through the Missional Engagement course, you'll be able to identify your neighborhood's rhythms and needs, allowing you to engage in more effective ministry.

            Joanna Goddard’s lifestyle blog (and many would also argue a fashion blog, style blog, food blog, interior design blog, parenting blog & relationship blog all rolled into one) is a wonderful blog example to learn from, particularly when it comes to creating a life enriching brand around your own personal interests—something Joanna’s done remarkably well.

        With topics that range widely from discussing her young children’s separation anxiety, to her favorite nail polish colors of the season, fashion trends in New York City, what it’s like to travel as a queer black woman and SO much more, there’s a very relatable, real, kind & compassionate thread woven throughout everything on the Cup of Jo blog.

        So, what makes Cup of Jo such a successful blog example today?
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4> and easy to navigate blog design: </h4>Cup of Jo has a very straightforward, easy to navigate blog layout that isn’t cluttered with ads or complicated content widgets. The vibe you get when you land on her blog is very inviting, welcoming and encourages readers to click around to the articles they’re most drawn toward.

            <li>
                <h4>Meaningful content from real people, being vulnerable:</h4> If you’re like me, you can immediately tell whether a blogger has their guard up with their writing, or if they’re sharing vulnerably from the heart. It’s a given that everything you’ll read on the Cup of Jo lifestyle blog, will fall into the latter camp.

            </li>
        </ul>
        It’s no surprise that Joanna’s site has grown into such a successful blog example to learn from, particularly for those considering a lifestyle blog that can cover a wide range of topics.

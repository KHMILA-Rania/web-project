            <h3>Trying too hard</h3>
            Back in 2003 just as the "missional church" conversation was gaining steam, I left a safe and comfortable senior pastor role in a middle-sized church to set off with a small group of people and live as missionaries in a new, suburban development, in the far northern suburbs of Perth, Western Australia. These five families had literally sold their homes in the eastern hills of Perth and moved over sixty kilometres west towards the ocean, with their focus on sharing the gospel in this new area. It was a venture founded in faith, strategically executed and I expected it to the be the next good news story in Australian mission.
            <br>
            It wasn't. It bombed. Despite all the effort I put in, despite our great knowledge of how to form missional communities and my own pit-bull intensity, we just didn't see people come to faith and our own team struggled with in-fighting and conflict. I had such high hopes for this venture, but when we wrapped it up six years later I had my tail between my legs and a sense of having participated in (and led) people in a giant failure.
            <br>
            What really confused me was the fact that we did everything right. We had the right posture, good strategies and the skills to lead people to faith. We immersed ourselves in the community, attended every party and joined every social group, but it felt like we were never making ground. We tried so hard... but to no avail.
            <h3>We Stopped Trying</h3>
            As Upstream, our missional community, finished, a small local church called and asked me to be their pastor – part time, for 2 days a week, while I ran my irrigation business. While I was feeling pretty deflated by our poor showing, I still held hope that a group of people could be led in mission, so we agreed to go back to church and see if we could form a missionary team out of these folks.
            <br>
            A few years further on we moved house – just twenty minutes further north but to what was once a holiday village. Development was catching up to it, but it kept its quiet beachside vibe. As we moved in I made no special plans to evangelise, or to reach out to anyone. I decided I was just going to get on with my life and if anything happened then it would be God rather than me. 
            <br>
            It was a conscious choice not to approach mission as I had previously. So we just got on and lived life. I ran my irrigation business and grew a strong local customer base. I surfed at our local beaches and made some good friends. I walked my dog along the beach, flew my drone and took images of the beach and back at home I roasted my own coffee, in my hobby roaster. And strangely enough what happened was that mission started to happen and it actually felt effortless. Where before I had tried so hard, now I was just being myself and keying into the moments where it seemed God was at work.

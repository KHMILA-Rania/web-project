            Today, my personal blog (here) reaches an audience 
            of 500,000+ monthly readers on topics related 
            to blogging, marketing, SEO, writing, business
             and freelancing. And while Iâ€™m now a successful
              blog example of my own, earning between
               $20,000 and $50,000/mo, it wasnâ€™t always 
               this way.

            I started my blog in 2014 with the goal of sharing high quality content, pulling lessons learned from my own journey of operating multiple side businesses while getting started in my career as a content marketer (including this early guide on How to Create a Product Nobody Wants and Lose $6,537).
            Over the years as I began to attract more readers to my personal blog, the questions I fielded from my audience became more clearly focused around how to build a blog audience & monetize a readership of their own. Thatâ€™s why today, the vast majority of my educational content is centered around teaching everything about blogging with all my heart.
            <br />
            <br />
            Taking a closer look at why Iâ€™ve become a successful blogger example, hereâ€™s what works for me:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Simple, approachable, in-depth educational content:</h4> About 5 years ago, I decided to go all in on delivering the highest quality guides on everything I know (and continue learning) about blogging here on my own blog. With that goal in mind, Iâ€™ve created hundreds of long-form content guides that are designed to walk beginner bloggers step-by-step through the process of everything from budgeting for the costs of blogging, to starting their blogs, getting traffic & making money blogging. That approach has helped my content rank high in search engines, too.

                <li>
                    <h4>99% of my blog content is free:</h4> Blogging has been a powerful tool for setting myself free from the constraints of having a traditional 9 to 5 job, and I want that same kind of freedom for everyone whoâ€™s seeking it. For that reason, almost everything I create is given away for free here on my blog. The only real exception is my in-depth course, Built to Blog, where I expand on everything I teach about blogging & go to much greater depth than I do here publicly on my blog. You can learn more about Built to Blog in my roundup of all the best blogging courses.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Transparent and real:</h4> Iâ€™m the first person to share about my own failures here on my personal blog, whether in the form of mistakes Iâ€™ve made as a blogger, open financial figures in my blog income reports, or the humble advice I give in my YouTube videos. I lay this mission out clearly on my homepage, and I also take the time to reply to every single comment thatâ€™s left here on my blog (even if that reply comes weeks later when Iâ€™m busy ðŸ˜Š). I attribute a lot of my blogging success to how much Iâ€™ve worked to show up as just another real human over hereâ€”always learning, experimenting and sitting right next to you on this remarkable journey of life. Though donâ€™t expect my site to turn into a lifestyle blog anytime soon.

                </li>
            </ul>
